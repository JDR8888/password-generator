# Description
A random, secure password generator that takes input from the user to choose password length between 8-128 characters (and will generate a random # between 1 and 128 if the user does not input correctly). Next, the user will answer window prompts as to whether they want lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters for the password. The generator will then randomly create a password using only the characters specified. The function includes a safecheck to account for the user not choosing any character type in that the function will be recalled (through recursion) to ask again for the user to select which characters they would like to use.
below is a screenshot of the thought process behind the primary function (generatePassword)
