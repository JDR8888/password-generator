# Description
A random, secure password generator that takes input from the user to choose password length between 8-128 characters (and will generate a random # between 1 and 128 if the user does not input correctly). Next, the user will answer window prompts as to whether they want lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters for the password. The generator will then randomly create a password using only the characters specified
